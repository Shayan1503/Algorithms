#Algorithms <br>

This project contains two utility classes <code>sort</code> and <code>search</code> of generic type 
<code>T</code>. As the name suggests, <code>sort</code> has methods for sorting algorithms, while <code>search</code>
has methods for searching algorithms. <br>
Most of my knowledge for these algorithms come from 
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">this book</a>.
