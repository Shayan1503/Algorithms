# Algorithms

This project contains two utility classes `sort` and `search` of generic type 
`T`. As the name suggests, `sort` has methods for sorting algorithms, while `search`
has methods for searching algorithms. <br>

Most of my knowledge for these algorithms come from [this book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition). <br>
All the time complexities mentioned in the `javadoc` comments are for worst-case.
